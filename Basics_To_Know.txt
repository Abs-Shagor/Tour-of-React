/// Some Core Concepts of React which we use in most of the code
1. Components – Reusable UI blocks (function MyComponent() {....}).
2. JSX –  is a JavaScript syntax that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
3. Rendering  – Displaying components in webpage
4. Conditional Rendering – Showing/hiding components on some conditions  ({isLoggedIn && <Profile />}).
5. Props(Properties) – Passing data to components (<Component prop={value}> < Component />).
6. Event Handling – Responding to user actions (onClick={handleClick}).
7. Hooks – Reusable logic (useState, useEffect, etc.).
8. useState – We use it where the Data changes over time.
9. useEffect  – We use it  to perform side effects(outside operations ex. API calls) after rendering.
